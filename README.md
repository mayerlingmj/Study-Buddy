### **_Description_**

The objectives of a study group can vary depending on the specific context and goals of the participants. A study group revolves around enhancing understanding, promoting active learning, fostering collaboration, and providing support to help members achieve their academic goals. Our website will have schools who offer study buddy sessions on multiple subject areas. The website will allow students to sign up for the subject area in which they believe they need the most assistance or have the most interest in. Students will be able to enroll in various subject areas and then view a complete list of all study buddy groups available which pertain to their selected school as well as any of their selected subjects.
